Out of that, a year and a half on Aragon. With Aragon growing, my <strong>responsibility</strong> has increased to levels I have never experienced.</p>\n<p>To add to that, I moved <strong>four times in the past two years</strong>. To Palo Alto, then Sunnyvale, then Barcelona, Madrid, and finally Zug, Switzerland. I have dealt with tons of <strong>stressful experiences</strong> in regards to visas and legal stuff. I had to <strong>manage a remote team</strong> for the first time. And all this inside the <strong>crypto</strong> world, the craziest and fastest-moving space there is.</p>\n<p>To do all that, I have found two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Refusing to life and working 14 hours per day</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optimizing productivity to the greatest and trying to work no more than 8–10 hours a day</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have tried #1 for a couple years with no good results. It’s <strong>unsustainable</strong> and makes you <strong>unhappy</strong>. It’s crappy and undesirable. Plus in the long term, you end up <strong>regretting not having time</strong> for your girlfriend, family and friends. And regretting is the worst.</p>\n<p>So I opted for <strong>maximizing productivity</strong>. It happened while I was trying #1 out. I was living in the Bay Area and couldn’t afford to eat anything more than nachos, pasta and Soylent. So it wasn’t the best of the situations. I started working 14 hours a day and almost burned out. I was <strong>first-time CEO</strong>, and I was discovering the amount of work involved into getting <em>“easy stuff”</em> done. At one point, eating so bad and working so much started making me feel ill.</p>\n<p>Not only mentally exhausted, but also physically ill. At that point, the only thing I could do is to learn how to cook and play sports.</p>\n<p>Doing both takes time. Thus, I couldn’t work during those hours. <strong>I needed to increase my output while working less hours</strong>. The only answer was being more productive. I have always tried to increase my productivity, but even more since that key moment.</p>\n<p>A lot of the learnings I had seem like <strong>common sense</strong> to me now. But <strong>in a world full of distractions</strong>, I realized focus and productivity are not the norm, but the exception.</p>\n<p>In <strong>becoming a better manager</strong>, Monica advised me to be transparent about the way I work. First, because that would <strong>help the people I work with</strong> to understand me better. Second, because my learnings may be helpful.</p>\n<p>So I will document my learnings by writing a series of <strong>very practical, short blog posts</strong>. I hope this series is helpful to my Aragon One family, to the crypto community, and to any other readers.</p>\n<p>During this blog series, I want to cover topics like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.luisivan.net/being-healthy-and-how-it-increases-productivity-9c26c4fa8cc5\">Being healthy and how it increases productivity</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.luisivan.net/saying-no-should-be-the-rule-not-the-exception-be8828110ea\">Saying no and not feeling bad about it</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Becoming a morning person and how it helped me</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being conscious about coffee and alcohol intake</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.luisivan.net/debugging-your-day-f293b52b24d0\">Debugging your day to optimize your time</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Digging deep into topics by having topic-based days</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"/posts/processing-reads\">Processing what you read</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Freeing the mind during the weekend</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Escaping from undesired inputs by filtering notifications</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Setting up a nice workspace</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Setting up a nice digital workspace</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://luisivan.net/leveraging-travel\">Leveraging travel so it doesn’t get into the way</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scheduling calls so all your time doesn’t get consumed by others</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.luisivan.net/setting-daily-and-weekly-goals-ee71dc807f08\">Setting daily and weekly goals</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.luisivan.net/saving-time-by-writing-better-11bce34f4631\">Being brief while still communicative</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope they also help me <em>debug myself</em> and further increase my productivity by revisiting how I could enhance those aspects.</p>\n<p>✌</p>","fields":{"slug":"/a-series-on-personal-productivity-640397638e8","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-08-13","description":"Tips and tricks on how to increase work output while being healthy and happy","tags":null,"title":"A series on personal productivity","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/a-series-on-personal-productivity-640397638e8"}}
