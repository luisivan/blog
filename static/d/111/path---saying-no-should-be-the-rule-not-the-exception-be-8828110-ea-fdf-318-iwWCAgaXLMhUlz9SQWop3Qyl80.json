But <strong>that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s negative</strong> for the world, your project, or your time. In a world full of <strong>distractions</strong>, we are always <strong>pushed to make positive choices</strong>. If we couldnâ€™t say no, we would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Work in jobs we dislike</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>End up in relationships we dislike</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Eat stuff we dislike</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Commit to activities we donâ€™t enjoy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have unwanted responsibilities that restrict our freedom</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some symptoms of this happening in a professional context are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Being always busy trying to please other peopleâ€™s wants</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>De-prioritizing priorities and prioritizing what other people want from you</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not being able to meet your goals, yet feeling very busy and overwhelmed</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has happened to all us in our lifetime. Committing to that event, to that call, to writing that email, doing that introâ€¦</p>\n<p>If you are experiencing the above, <strong>it should be fine to say no</strong>. Yet sometimes people can think you are <strong>rude for declining</strong>.

We took the time to make a proposal, yet they donâ€™t take the time to review it and the time to commit to it?</p>\n<p>Well, the answer may be <strong>lack of information</strong>, which leads to lack of empathy. A good example are events. If someone looked at my agenda, they would guess that I cannot attend to more events this year. But since the other person doesnâ€™t have the information, they donâ€™t know. They could do a search of all important crypto events and see if Iâ€™m talking, but that would be cumbersome for them. Thus they go forward and invite me to their event as well.</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t want to attend their event, itâ€™s just that I have too many.</p>\n<p>In this case, and most cases Iâ€™d say, <strong>itâ€™s not that people want to take advantage of us</strong>, but that <strong>they donâ€™t know our context</strong>. If they knew, they wouldnâ€™t propose it to us in the first place.</p>\n<p>This is a very important realization. Other people donâ€™t know our context as we do. So when someone proposes something to you, think this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If they were me and knew everything I know, would they still propose this?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the answer is no, then you should automatically decline.</p>\n<h2 id=\"priority-misalignment\"><a href=\"#priority-misalignment\" aria-label=\"priority misalignment permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Priority misalignment</h2>\n<p>Another realization is that people like to push <strong>their</strong> roadmap. We all have our particular roadmap, whether purely personal or part of a project. When people make decisions, like making proposals to someone else, <strong>keep this in mind</strong>. While your priority #1 is your role and project, theirs is their role and their project!</p>\n<p>This is a very <strong>obvious</strong> realization, but helps to prevent situations in which you end up <strong>feeling used</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"doesnt-feel-right-its-probably-a-no\"><a href=\"#doesnt-feel-right-its-probably-a-no\" aria-label=\"doesnt feel right its probably a no permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Doesnâ€™t feel right? Itâ€™s probably a no</h2>\n<p>We try to convince ourselves that things may change, but truth is that our gut is usually <strong>very accurate</strong>. If you are very busy with your core goals, every minute you invest into something is a <strong>bet you make</strong>. Be conscious about that. <strong>If you make a bet, consider it so</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you donâ€™t want to make a bet, then <strong>pass</strong>!

Then they gradually become less clearâ€¦ and sometimes we lose them completely.</p>\n<p>If you donâ€™t say no, you can end up with <strong>weird situations</strong>. Like having more commitments with people outside your team than with your teammates. Or spending more time in random tasks than in tasks aligned with your goals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"politely-declining\"><a href=\"#politely-declining\" aria-label=\"politely declining permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Politely declining</h2>\n<p>There are many ways to decline a proposal, some are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Giving <strong>context</strong> to the other person on your rejection <strong>motive</strong>. Example: <em>I cannot make it to this event because I have my event year fully booked</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mentioning that you wouldnâ€™t be able to commit because you <strong>wouldnâ€™t meet expectations</strong>. Example: <em>Iâ€™d love to, but if I did I probably wouldnâ€™t be able to carry it on wellâ€¦ so I prefer not to commit and set false expectations</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Referring to <strong>internal policies</strong>. Example: <em>Iâ€™d love to take a look, but we have a very strict policy on the kinds of projects we fund. So I think your project would fit better into another program</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Referring to <strong>personal policies</strong>. Example: <em>Great connecting! Unfortunately I donâ€™t use Telegram for work, so just send me an email!</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, if the other party was thoughtful about their proposal, <strong>be thankful</strong>! At the end of the day, <strong>itâ€™s beautiful that people think of you</strong> or your project. The fact that you are declining shouldnâ€™t interfere with <strong>being nice and respectful</strong>.</p>\n<p>With that said, thanks for reading! ðŸ‘‹</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You can find more posts about personal productivity in <a href=\"https://blog.luisivan.net/a-series-on-personal-productivity-640397638e8\">my series about it</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/saying-no-should-be-the-rule-not-the-exception-be8828110ea","tagSlugs":["/tag/productivity/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-08-17","description":"Regaining control of your life and time by saying no","tags":["Productivity"],"title":"Saying no should be the rule, not the exception","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/saying-no-should-be-the-rule-not-the-exception-be8828110ea"}}
