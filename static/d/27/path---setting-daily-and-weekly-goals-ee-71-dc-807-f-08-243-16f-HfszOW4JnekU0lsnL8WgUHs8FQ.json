The less time you use, with the higher impact you achieve, the better. Increasing your <strong>leverage</strong>.</p>\n<p>Seems obvious, but it requires a lot of effort. You have to <strong>always question the leverage</strong> of your activities. This is very hard to do in a rolling basis, since itâ€™d be cumbersome to question every single second of your day.</p>\n<p>I want to describe how to batch those prioritization moments, so you get the most impact out of time.</p>\n<p>This post assumes you already have a way to establish yearly/quarterly goals. I will focus on daily and weekly goals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setting-a-weekly-to-do-list\"><a href=\"#setting-a-weekly-to-do-list\" aria-label=\"setting a weekly to do list permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Setting a weekly to-do list</h2>\n<p>The simplest, the better. Even if you use a task management tool, write down <strong>3 to 5 goals you have for the week</strong>.</p>\n<p>Isnâ€™t it duplication? Well, first, <strong>repetition helps focus</strong>. Second, task management is much more advanced, and usually helps others know what you are up to. In this case we are <strong>creating this list just for ourselves</strong>.</p>\n<p>Stick that list somewhere where you can see it. If itâ€™s paper, put it on your desk. If itâ€™s digital, somewhere a click away.</p>\n<p>When you have the slightest doubt that what you are doing may not be the right thing, check the list.</p>\n<p>Write this list when the week starts. Do it as the very first thing of your week, and <strong>lock 15â€“30 minutes to write it</strong>. It can seem like a lot of time for writing a 3â€“5 item list, but properly prioritizing can save you more time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setting-time-slots-to-work-on-your-goals\"><a href=\"#setting-time-slots-to-work-on-your-goals\" aria-label=\"setting time slots to work on your goals permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Setting time slots to work on your goals</h2>\n<p>I used to let tasks flow during the day. That generally works well, and itâ€™s perfect if you are in the <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html\">makerâ€™s schedule</a>. Yet since Iâ€™m in both the managerâ€™s schedule and the makerâ€™s schedule, it doesnâ€™t work that well.</p>\n<p>I found that I didnâ€™t have the time to fill tasks since they <strong>always took more time than expected</strong>. And, since I didnâ€™t measure any fixed time for each of them, I had no way of accurately planning my day.</p>\n<p>When the week starts, I try to <strong>fill as much of my calendar</strong> as possible.</p>\n<p>I put <strong>tasks derived from my weekly goals</strong>, and try to <strong>estimate</strong> the time they will take.</p>\n<p>Of course, I leave some blank space too. Itâ€™s usually in the early morning, lunch break and before ending the day. I try to catch up on stuff in the morning and last thing in the evening. As I get a lot of inputs, I need to allocate another ~2h/day to those. But since I have my goals blocked on the calendar, <strong>I prioritize those over the external inputs</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Q9HIwVeOQMpC1sIM4u5guQ.png\"></p>\n<p>This doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m not responsive or talking to my team. As thatâ€™s a priority for me, I also block slots for those purposes.</p>\n<p>This system helps me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure I will have focus time to work on the tasks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare myself mentally to take on those tasks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn how to estimate time</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"getting-better-at-time-estimation\"><a href=\"#getting-better-at-time-estimation\" aria-label=\"getting better at time estimation permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Getting better at time estimation</h2>\n<p>Time estimation is a very undervalued skill. It goes a long way.</p>\n<p>This method makes you better at estimating time, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you arenâ€™t right on an estimation, you probably have to <strong>re-schedule your complete day</strong>. My day is extremely packed, so if a task takes more time, I have to re-think my day again. Incentives are for me to be on time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As you commit mistakes, you learn which kinds of tasks take more or less time, so you correct over time</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Thatâ€™s it! It is an extremely simple method, but it works.</p>\n<p>The only thing this method requires from you is very <strong>strong commitment</strong>.</p>\n<p>ðŸ’ª</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You can find more posts about personal productivity in <a href=\"https://blog.luisivan.net/a-series-on-personal-productivity-640397638e8\">my series about it</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/setting-daily-and-weekly-goals-ee71dc807f08","tagSlugs":["/tag/productivity/","/tag/goals/","/tag/time-management/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-09-13","description":"Reducing the noise so you can focus on what matters","tags":["Productivity","Goals","Time management"],"title":"Setting daily and weekly goals","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/setting-daily-and-weekly-goals-ee71dc807f08"}}
