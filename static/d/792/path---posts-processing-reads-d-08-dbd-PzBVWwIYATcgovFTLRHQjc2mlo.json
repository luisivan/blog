I carefully select highlights from most that I read. In the end, those are the actionable items that could be helpful in my day to day.

Read on an e-reader</h2>\n<p><em>‚ÄúBut paper feels good‚Ä¶‚Äù</em> I‚Äôm personally not on that camp, but even if I was, <strong>e-reading is just superior</strong>. At least for non-fiction books, which is what I‚Äôm covering in this post. Why? Because you can <strong>highlight and export your highlights</strong> in a click.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-re-construct-the-logical-path-to-conclusions\"><a href=\"#2-re-construct-the-logical-path-to-conclusions\" aria-label=\"2 re construct the logical path to conclusions permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Re-construct the logical path to conclusions</h2>\n<p>Usually non-fiction books come in the <code class=\"language-text\">explanation-&gt;conclusion</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">cause-&gt;effect</code> form.</p>\n<p>You <strong>don‚Äôt want to absorb false information</strong>, or <strong>truthful information without understanding it</strong>. You need to <strong>re-construct the logical path that the author takes</strong> to reach their conclusion. To do that, just question everything the author writes. No matter how famous the author is, <strong>be skeptic.</strong></p>\n<p>This also helps you remember, <strong>since you are constructing your own logical path</strong> to reach the conclusion. That makes you have a <strong>small a-ha moment</strong>, which will make the memory stick better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-highlight-with-context\"><a href=\"#3-highlight-with-context\" aria-label=\"3 highlight with context permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. Highlight with context</h2>\n<p>Make sure to select highlights carefully so they are not too verbose, but also not missing context.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I was going to read this highlight without any context one year from now, would I know what‚Äôs going on?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"4-refresh-your-highlights\"><a href=\"#4-refresh-your-highlights\" aria-label=\"4 refresh your highlights permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4. Refresh your highlights</h2>\n<p>Use something like <a href=\"https://readwise.io\">Readwise</a> to import your highlights. The tool will send you <strong>daily digests</strong> with them, so you are <strong>constantly refreshing your highlights</strong>.</p>\n<p>It will also let you <strong>tag your highlights</strong>, so you will have your knowledge categorized.</p>\n<p>Refreshing your highlights is probably the most important step. If you read a lot but forget all the actionable pieces of knowledge, does it matter to read so much?</p>\n<p>Reading a lot is a status symbol, but I think that‚Äôs the wrong metric. You want to <strong>accumulate quality knowledge and apply it to your everyday work and life</strong>. That‚Äôs all that matters.</p>\n<p>So it‚Äôs better to take a single read and apply actionable items from it, than to read a thousand books and not apply that knowledge.</p>\n<p>This also means being conscious about your limitations.</p>\n<p>We don‚Äôt have power to absorb infinite knowledge, and we certainly don‚Äôt have the time to apply all of it. Sometimes, that means <strong>limiting what you read so you can focus on applying the latest acquired knowledge</strong>, before jumping to absorb even more knowledge. </p>\n<p>üìö</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You can find more posts about personal productivity in <a href=\"https://blog.luisivan.net/a-series-on-personal-productivity-640397638e8\">my series about it</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/processing-reads","tagSlugs":["/tag/productivity/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Tools and processes to make sure you take advantage of what you read","tags":["Productivity"],"title":"Processing what you read","image":"/media/readwise.png"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/posts/processing-reads"}}
