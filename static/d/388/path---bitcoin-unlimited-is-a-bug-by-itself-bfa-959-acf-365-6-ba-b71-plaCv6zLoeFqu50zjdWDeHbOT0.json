The theoretical number of transactions per second is in the single digits. There’s a block each ~10mins, and each block is 1MB.</p>\n<p>Developers have proposed various solutions during the years.</p>\n<p>The one that <strong>miners have been supporting</strong> lately <strong>is Bitcoin Unlimited</strong>.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin Unlimited takes a very simple approach to scaling. Let’s make the blocks bigger, that should work! Let’s hope users and miners will reach <em>emergent consensus</em> over the block size, and live happily ever after!</p>\n<p>But <strong>the consequences of leaving the block size open to the miner consensus are terrible. They centralize the currency</strong>. I’ll explain why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"making-mining-an-oligopoly\"><a href=\"#making-mining-an-oligopoly\" aria-label=\"making mining an oligopoly permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Making mining an oligopoly</h2>\n<p>Top miners would be incentivized to <strong>push the block size even more</strong>, to push out some of their competition. Some miners wouldn’t have the computing power, or it wouldn’t be cost efficient for them to process larger and larger blocks, so <strong>they would retire</strong>.</p>\n<p>Repeat that process slowly, kicking out a low percentage of miners each time, and <strong>you would have taken over Bitcoin</strong>. You would own and control it. It’s true that even if that happens, miners couldn’t do certain things — for example they can’t fake a transaction for you. <strong>But they could double spend, meaning that the currency is worthless.</strong></p>\n<p>If mining is very centralized now, imagine with BU. Basically a very powerful miner called Jihan Wu would control it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ending-full-nodes\"><a href=\"#ending-full-nodes\" aria-label=\"ending full nodes permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Ending full nodes</h2>\n<p>Today’s block size is 1MB. With that block size, the blockchain already is >100GB. <strong>I can run a full node on my 1TB disk</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>But if the block size was 10MB, I couldn’t</strong>. Meaning that soon <strong>I wouldn’t be able to run my own full node, and should trust others</strong>.</p>\n<p>Decentralized, trustless currency? No more.</p>\n<p>So Bitcoin Unlimited is a huge bug itself. It’s a joke. It’s a way of <strong>selling a soon-to-be centralized coin as if it was Bitcoin</strong>. It’s bundling a backdoor into Bitcoin so a couple miners can control it.</p>\n<p>And this is just from the technical standpoint. I won’t go into the specifics of what the <strong>BU mafia has done</strong> to promote their interests. Or into <strong>their nonexistent programming skills</strong>, bundling critic bugs into their software. That could be another very long story. They’re toxic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"okay-whats-the-solution-then\"><a href=\"#okay-whats-the-solution-then\" aria-label=\"okay whats the solution then permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Okay… what’s the solution then?</h2>\n<p><strong>SegWit</strong> (Segregated Witnesses). SegWit solves a well known problem called transaction malleability.</p>\n<p>Transactions have identifiers. Right now, creating a transaction it will have a certain ID. But if I create the same transaction and re-sign it, the cloned transaction will have a different ID from the original. So it may spend the same coins, but the transaction will have a different ID.</p>\n<p>Malleability was the major hurdle for <strong>payment channels</strong>, which can make Bitcoin <strong>infinitely scalable</strong>.</p>\n<p>So with SegWit, you can have both <strong>millions of transactions per second</strong> and <strong>instant confirmations</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-miners-dont-like-it\"><a href=\"#why-miners-dont-like-it\" aria-label=\"why miners dont like it permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why miners don’t like it?</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*Z6VQRfZkMAn20Th_iwak0w.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>They now have <strong>the opportunity to become decision makers at the protocol level</strong>.

Nope.</p>\n<p>Normally we would say that the longest chain, and the one with more hash rate is the legit one.</p>\n<p>Yet that chain would have a built-in bug to become centralized.
