Sometime in the next couple of years I heard about it again, but this time I took the chance to <strong>read Satoshi’s paper</strong>.</p>\n<p>I was amazed, and finally understood what the Bitcoin movement was about. I think this was circa 2012–2013, just after I moved to live on my own.</p>\n<p>After reading the paper, I bought some Bitcoins at about ~$100. Unfortunately, I was working on my own stuff without any stable source of income, so at one point I had to sell them at ~$150 to pay rent and continue working on my own stuff.</p>\n<p>After some months the story repeated — I bought at ~$1000 and sold at more or less the same price.</p>\n<p>The point is that <strong>I was not a super early adopter in the cryptocurrency space</strong>, so I’m not gonna talk about how I bought Bitcoins for cents and sold them for thousands — that didn’t happen.</p>\n<p>So, knowing that I missed the first Bitcoin train, I’m going to talk about how I figured out strategies to get on other cryptocurrencies. With these steps and a good amount of luck, <strong>I managed to make >900% with one of my investments</strong> and like 300% overall. I also have to say that I’m a total hobbyist, and I’m investing super small quantities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-decentralization-changes-everything-look-for-new-tech-that-leverages-it\"><a href=\"#1-decentralization-changes-everything-look-for-new-tech-that-leverages-it\" aria-label=\"1 decentralization changes everything look for new tech that leverages it permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>1. Decentralization changes everything. Look for new tech that leverages it</h2>\n<p>If you put <em>decentralized</em> before other words, great stuff happens. Decentralized currency. Decentralized storage. Decentralized cats. Decentralized Tinder matches.</p>\n<p>The thing is, being decentralized doesn’t help making a cat better. Or a Tinder match. Or Donald Trump. Well. Maybe.</p>\n<p>I always try to look for things in which decentralization is a game changer.</p>\n<p>In Bitcoin’s case, being decentralized is everything. Moving value in an uncontrolled way can have a huge impact on the world. Removing governments. Being more efficient by removing intermediaries. Providing a democratic way to decide on the future of the network.</p>\n<p><strong>Beware of projects that are decentralized because of the hype</strong>. Yeah, in some areas decentralization doesn’t provide much value. Making a long story short: where trust in a central organization is key, decentralization usually doesn’t add up much value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-a-product-that-works--a-team-that-can-build-it\"><a href=\"#2-a-product-that-works--a-team-that-can-build-it\" aria-label=\"2 a product that works  a team that can build it permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. A product that works / a team that can build it</h2>\n<p>In the blockchain world, I have seen too many <em>blockchain experts</em> having ideas that don’t make any sense / can’t be implemented.</p>\n<p>I can’t stress enough how important is to have a strong technical background if you want to build the next big thing in the crypto space.</p>\n<p>For example, I really like <a href=\"https://sia.tech/\">Sia</a>’s team. I met them a couple times, they’re brilliant hackers. They came out with a working product super quick, and they continue enhancing it constantly. You can have a look at their GitHub, it’s pretty amazing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-something-where-a-token-makes-sense\"><a href=\"#3-something-where-a-token-makes-sense\" aria-label=\"3 something where a token makes sense permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. Something where a token makes sense</h2>\n<p>Having a token is the requirement for having a crowdsale. It makes both fundraising and revenue so easy for crypto projects.</p>\n<p>However, there are a lot of scenarios in which a token doesn’t make any sense.</p>\n<p>For example, I still have yet to meet anyone who thinks <a href=\"http://factom.org/\">Factom</a> having a token makes any sense.</p>\n<p>The opposite case would be <a href=\"http://augur.net/\">Augur</a> — where having a token is the way of having a more or less optimal distribution of reputation. In Augur, reputation is everything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-invest-super-early\"><a href=\"#4-invest-super-early\" aria-label=\"4 invest super early permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4. Invest super early</h2>\n<p>If it has reached the mainstream, it’s just not my kind of investment. I’m not a full time trader, it’s just something I do sometimes in my free time. I want to put some money early on, and forget for a while.</p>\n<p>The best way to do so is to invest in the crowdsale. Or when it’s already traded, but the product is in a super early stage and hasn’t demonstrated anything tangible, so it has huge possibilities of going up when it gains traction / media coverage.</p>\n<p>So, to wrap up, I love investment in cryptocurrencies, because <strong>it has almost no friction and can make you triple digit returns pretty easily</strong>. Or triple negative digits. So before trying this at home, beware of the pump and dump!</p>\n<p><em>Props to Daniele, my cofounder at Stampery, from whom I learnt most of the crypto-investment stuff I know.</em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/investing-in-crypto-101-679c6c64ef46","tagSlugs":["/tag/money/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-08-22","description":"","tags":["Money"],"title":"Investing in crypto 101","image":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/investing-in-crypto-101-679c6c64ef46"}}
