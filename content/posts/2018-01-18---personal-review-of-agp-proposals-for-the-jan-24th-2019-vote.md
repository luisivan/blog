I wanted to do a quick summary, since decentralized governance is very new and may seem daunting.

First of all, a first disclaimer: My intention is **not to influence voting behavior**. This post aims to be as neutral as possible. That is why it’s coming from my personal Medium account. I have **ordered AGPs by number** with neutrality in mind too.

Now, a second disclaimer: I don’t aim to vote with all my tokens, except force majeure situations. I may vote with just 1 ANT to go through the voting experience.

## [AGP-5: Aragon One Flock proposal](https://github.com/aragonone/flock/blob/master/teams/Aragon%20One/2019.md)

**Who**: Aragon One, the main team leading Aragon’s development

**What**: Aims to expand to 25 people. Work includes: identity, DAOs interacting with external dapps, the app center, more flexible permissions, responsive, metatransactions, new voting architecture and the Aragon Network

**Funding**: $4m for 2019 operations, and 1,675,000 ANT for the next 4 years

**Possible upside**: The Aragon One team is in its best moment. With funding, it will keep attracting the best talent and forming a stable team

**Possible downside**: Although it is a very cost efficient team, it needs sizable funding due to its magnitude

## [AGP-10: Community Funding DAO](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/10/files)

**Who**: A DAO controlled by ANT holders

**What**: Fund low-cost, low-risk bounties that are proposed and voted on by ANT holders

**Funding**: 12,500 DAI

**Possible upside**: More community engagement and contributors

**Possible downside**: Governance of the DAO may fail and we may lost some money on unwanted bounties

## [AGP-11: Association annual budget](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-11.md)

**Who**: Aragon Association

**What**: Fund the Aragon Association operations and enable it to expand its team to 4 people. That includes the Executive Director (Stefano), a Program Manager, an Operations Manager and an Events Manager

**Funding**: 820k CHF for 2019 operations, and 300k ANT for the next 3 years

**Possible upside**: The Association will take work off the teams’ shoulders and enable them to focus on product

**Possible downside**: The current team is just Stefano and it may take a couple months to fill the current openings

## [AGP-12: Aragon holiday](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/12/files)

**What**: Set Feb 10th as the *Fight for Freedom day*, Aragon’s holiday

**Possible upside**: Having a day recognized and celebrated by the whole community

**Possible downside**: -

## [AGP-14: Improve voting logistics](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/14/files)

**What**: Very reasonable changes to simplify the AGP process. Also changes the time votes happen, from 00:00 UTC to 16:00 UTC

**Possible upside**: Majority of core devs will not have to be up at unreasonable times when the vote happens

**Possible downside**: -

## [AGP-16: Extend voting duration](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/16/files)

**What**: Extend voting duration from 48h to last a week

**Possible upside**: More time to vote

**Possible downside**: More time to attack the vote

## [AGP-17: Nest annual budget](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/17/files)

**Who**: A DAO controlled by Flock team members and the Aragon Association

**What**: Continue running Aragon Nest, our grants program

**Funding**: $500k + 200k ANT

**Possible upside**: Nest keeps being one of the best grants program in the space

**Possible downside**: -

## [AGP-18: Authio proposal to become the Aragon Network security partner](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/18/files)

**Who**: [Authio](https://authio.org/), security auditors

**What**: Work together with core devs to ensure the security of all smart contracts

**Funding**: $215k

**Possible upside**: Having a security partner with passion for the project, funded by ANT holders to best serve their interests

**Possible downside**: Team that all core devs haven’t previously worked with(with a couple exceptions)

## [AGP-19: Autark Flock proposal](https://github.com/AutarkCo/flock/blob/autark-proposal/teams/Autark/2019Q1-2.md)

**Who**: Autark, a new team led by [Yalda](https://twitter.com/stellarmagnet) and [Quazia](https://twitter.com/lolllunn), who are Nest grantees too

**What**: Improve aragonAPI, work on rich user profiles, voting discussions, reputation systems, DAO templates, DAO storage, and a planning suite

**Funding**: $390k + 350k ANT

**Possible upside**: Having a team with strong leadership that loves the project

**Possible downside**: Newly formed team

That’s it for now! You can shape this vote by participating on the [Aragon chat](https://aragon.chat) and the [Aragon forum](https://forum.aragon.org). Best luck to all teams and AGP authors!
