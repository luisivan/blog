When I read about Bitcoin in 2009, I didn’t give it much attention. Sometime in the next couple of years I heard about it again, but this time I took the chance to **read Satoshi’s paper**.

I was amazed, and finally understood what the Bitcoin movement was about. I think this was circa 2012–2013, just after I moved to live on my own.

After reading the paper, I bought some Bitcoins at about ~\$100. Unfortunately, I was working on my own stuff without any stable source of income, so at one point I had to sell them at ~\$150 to pay rent and continue working on my own stuff.

After some months the story repeated — I bought at ~\$1000 and sold at more or less the same price.

The point is that **I was not a super early adopter in the cryptocurrency space**, so I’m not gonna talk about how I bought Bitcoins for cents and sold them for thousands — that didn’t happen.

So, knowing that I missed the first Bitcoin train, I’m going to talk about how I figured out strategies to get on other cryptocurrencies. With these steps and a good amount of luck, **I managed to make >900% with one of my investments** and like 300% overall. I also have to say that I’m a total hobbyist, and I’m investing super small quantities.

## 1. Decentralization changes everything. Look for new tech that leverages it

If you put *decentralized* before other words, great stuff happens. Decentralized currency. Decentralized storage. Decentralized cats. Decentralized Tinder matches.

The thing is, being decentralized doesn’t help making a cat better. Or a Tinder match. Or Donald Trump. Well. Maybe.

I always try to look for things in which decentralization is a game changer.

In Bitcoin’s case, being decentralized is everything. Moving value in an uncontrolled way can have a huge impact on the world. Removing governments. Being more efficient by removing intermediaries. Providing a democratic way to decide on the future of the network.

**Beware of projects that are decentralized because of the hype**. Yeah, in some areas decentralization doesn’t provide much value. Making a long story short: where trust in a central organization is key, decentralization usually doesn’t add up much value.

## 2. A product that works / a team that can build it

In the blockchain world, I have seen too many *blockchain experts* having ideas that don’t make any sense / can’t be implemented.

I can’t stress enough how important is to have a strong technical background if you want to build the next big thing in the crypto space.

For example, I really like [Sia](https://sia.tech/)’s team. I met them a couple times, they’re brilliant hackers. They came out with a working product super quick, and they continue enhancing it constantly. You can have a look at their GitHub, it’s pretty amazing.

## 3. Something where a token makes sense

Having a token is the requirement for having a crowdsale. It makes both fundraising and revenue so easy for crypto projects.

However, there are a lot of scenarios in which a token doesn’t make any sense.

For example, I still have yet to meet anyone who thinks [Factom](http://factom.org/) having a token makes any sense.

The opposite case would be [Augur](http://augur.net/) — where having a token is the way of having a more or less optimal distribution of reputation. In Augur, reputation is everything.

## 4. Invest super early

If it has reached the mainstream, it’s just not my kind of investment. I’m not a full time trader, it’s just something I do sometimes in my free time. I want to put some money early on, and forget for a while.

The best way to do so is to invest in the crowdsale. Or when it’s already traded, but the product is in a super early stage and hasn’t demonstrated anything tangible, so it has huge possibilities of going up when it gains traction / media coverage.

So, to wrap up, I love investment in cryptocurrencies, because **it has almost no friction and can make you triple digit returns pretty easily**. Or triple negative digits. So before trying this at home, beware of the pump and dump!

*Props to Daniele, my cofounder at Stampery, from whom I learnt most of the crypto-investment stuff I know.*
