I started working on software ten years ago, and on crypto about seven. Out of that, a year and a half on Aragon. With Aragon growing, my **responsibility** has increased to levels I have never experienced.

To add to that, I moved **four times in the past two years**. To Palo Alto, then Sunnyvale, then Barcelona, Madrid, and finally Zug, Switzerland. I have dealt with tons of **stressful experiences** in regards to visas and legal stuff. I had to **manage a remote team** for the first time. And all this inside the **crypto** world, the craziest and fastest-moving space there is.

To do all that, I have found two ways:

1. Refusing to life and working 14 hours per day

1. Optimizing productivity to the greatest and trying to work no more than 8–10 hours a day

I have tried #1 for a couple years with no good results. It’s **unsustainable** and makes you **unhappy**. It’s crappy and undesirable. Plus in the long term, you end up **regretting not having time** for your girlfriend, family and friends. And regretting is the worst.

So I opted for **maximizing productivity**. It happened while I was trying #1 out. I was living in the Bay Area and couldn’t afford to eat anything more than nachos, pasta and Soylent. So it wasn’t the best of the situations. I started working 14 hours a day and almost burned out. I was **first-time CEO**, and I was discovering the amount of work involved into getting *“easy stuff”* done. At one point, eating so bad and working so much started making me feel ill.

Not only mentally exhausted, but also physically ill. At that point, the only thing I could do is to learn how to cook and play sports.

Doing both takes time. Thus, I couldn’t work during those hours. **I needed to increase my output while working less hours**. The only answer was being more productive. I have always tried to increase my productivity, but even more since that key moment.

A lot of the learnings I had seem like **common sense** to me now. But **in a world full of distractions**, I realized focus and productivity are not the norm, but the exception.

In **becoming a better manager**, Monica advised me to be transparent about the way I work. First, because that would **help the people I work with** to understand me better. Second, because my learnings may be helpful.

So I will document my learnings by writing a series of **very practical, short blog posts**. I hope this series is helpful to my Aragon One family, to the crypto community, and to any other readers.

During this blog series, I want to cover topics like:

* [Being healthy and how it increases productivity](https://blog.luisivan.net/being-healthy-and-how-it-increases-productivity-9c26c4fa8cc5)

* [Saying no and not feeling bad about it](https://blog.luisivan.net/saying-no-should-be-the-rule-not-the-exception-be8828110ea)

* Becoming a morning person and how it helped me

* Being conscious about coffee and alcohol intake

* [Debugging your day to optimize your time](https://blog.luisivan.net/debugging-your-day-f293b52b24d0)

* Digging deep into topics by having topic-based days

* Freeing the mind during the weekend

* Escaping from undesired inputs by filtering notifications

* Setting up a nice workspace

* Setting up a nice digital workspace

* Controlling travel so it doesn’t get into the way

* Scheduling calls so all your time doesn’t get consumed by others

* [Setting daily and weekly goals](https://blog.luisivan.net/setting-daily-and-weekly-goals-ee71dc807f08)

* [Being brief while still communicative](https://blog.luisivan.net/saving-time-by-writing-better-11bce34f4631)

I hope they also help me *debug myself* and further increase my productivity by revisiting how I could enhance those aspects.
