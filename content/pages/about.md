![The way forward](/media/sand.jpg)

I am a freedom fighter creating tools for human liberation.

I believe that crypto is our chance to escape a technological dystopia and supersede the corrupt system that let it happen. We need open source technology that enables social change and has built-in economic incentives to propagate.

My most recent work has been in [Aragon](https://aragon.org), which I co-founded in 2016. Aragon is the leading decentralized governance platform, enabling Internet communities and institutions to empower their stakeholders. Aragon's technology secures more than $650m in assets and enables hundreds of thousands to participate in governance.

Before Aragon, I co-founded [Stampery](https://stampery.com), a pioneer in blockchain timestamping, in 2014. The company  pivoted into [Witnet](https://witnet.io), a decentralized oracle network.

I started my career working on free software, founding a Linux distribution called [Asturix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturix) in 2008, when I was 12 years old. During those early years, I co-founded multiple failed startups, advised the European Commission and learned a lot!
