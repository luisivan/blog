## Artificial Intelligence
AI is powerful, but can be a devastating weapon if monopolized.
Democratize artificial intelligence by using cryptoeconomic incentives.

### [DecentralizedAI](https://luisivan.net/idea-for-a-decentralized-open-source-platform-for-deep-machine-learning-advancement-b5b031e8f6f7) (Jan 2017)
Implement a crypto network that incentivizes data sharing and collaborative training for machine learning models. Dethrone Google and Facebook on AI by making all datasets public and having a massive network of machine learning miners.

Related efforts are [OpenMined](https://www.openmined.org), [Ocean](https://oceanprotocol.com). They focus on tangentially related problems, but don't implement the incentivization mechanism.

## Legal
Citizens need to resort to middleman to understand how society works. We can create technology that makes it easy for people to understand laws without hiring a lawyer.

In the short term, we can make lawyers less expensive by applying simple productivity learnings.

Most law firms leverage technology invented decades ago. Simple cloud technology and AI can make law firms 90% more efficient.
