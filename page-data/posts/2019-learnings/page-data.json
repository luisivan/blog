In those reflexive periods, things click. You look back, and you see a cohesive series of events that you can extract learnings from. I want to share some of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Discover uncomfortable truths</strong>: Uncomfortable truths about oneself are hard to discover because unveiling them usually hurts your own ego. But they are essential for personal growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Self confidence and stupidity are close neighbors</strong>: When I was a teen, I used to think that I knew <em>way more</em> than anyone else just because I had a younger, fresher perspective. That assumption is not only totally flawed, but also hurts learning and personal growth. Now I try to assume that everyone is smarter than me by default. This enables learning.</li>\n<li><strong>Say no</strong>: I’m overly idealistic and optimistic. Commitments pile and constrain. Saying no is the only way to not get into that situation in the first place.</li>\n<li><strong>Build something people want</strong>: Again, I’m overly idealistic. I usually dream about the world in a few decades, and then try to build that. Unfortunately the world doesn’t work that way. You cannot time travel and sell your product — so build something people want <em>now.</em></li>\n<li><strong>Spend less money</strong>: Even if you do have it, spending more creates commitments — both in startups and personal life, you end up being a victim of the sunk cost fallacy. Spend less, have less commitments.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://luisivan.net/value-what-you-have\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Value what you have</a></strong>: Remember this every morning and every night.</li>\n<li><strong>Listen</strong>: The people I work with are the best that I could ever dream of working with. The network that I have offers vast possibilities for advice — but to take advantage of it I need to <em>truly</em> listen. In meetings and calls, ask questions and let everyone speak first. Keep asking until you are satisfied. Act last.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat my ego</strong>: This is crucial for listening. Sometimes we only hear what we want to listen. Being a great leader means doing the best for the project, even if I need to face uncomfortable truths about myself.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t be superficial in my assumptions</strong>: Don’t be satisfied with having superficial arguments to defend my positions. Ask myself more questions, be thorough. Foundational assumptions are important and we cannot build off a flawed foundation.</li>\n<li><strong>Don’t be superficial</strong>, in general: Listen before speaking, read before writing, research before making assumptions, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Slow down to gain perspective</strong>: Sometimes slowing down enables getting on a faster direction. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/licuende/status/1205905592356880390\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Tunnel effect applies to life and startups as well</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Short-term focus, long-term outlook</strong>: Long-term visions are <em>only</em> achieved by winning short-term battles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m sure there are many others that I forgot. Thanks for reading, and hope you also take a few minutes to reflect and share yours!</p>\n<p>Wishing everyone a prolific 2020!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/2019-learnings","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-12-27","description":"Compiling my 2019 learnings after moments of clarity","tags":null,"title":"Learnings in 2019","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2019-learnings"}}}
