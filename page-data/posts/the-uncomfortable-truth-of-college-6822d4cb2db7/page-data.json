He was talking about an exciting use case of blockchains. The professor that was evaluating it considered that the topic was too broad.</p>\n<p>I stepped in and told her about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not innovative technology. Bitcoin was built upon distributed computing, cryptography, game theory and even philosophy that already existed prior to it.</p>\n<p>What set Bitcoin apart was the <strong>new usage that it made out of those existing technologies</strong>. Satoshi had a <strong>holistic view of how they would all fit together</strong>. It wouldn’t be possible if Satoshi was narrowly thinking.</p>\n<p><strong>Imagine Satoshi presenting Bitcoin at college, and the professor telling him that the topic is too broad</strong>. Or telling him that the whitepaper was just 9 pages long and not 100. This is one of the things that are wrong with college today, and why most of the next innovators and leaders will likely not come out of it. This is already happening and has been happening during the last decades, mainly with computer engineers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"hiring-can-be-efficient\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#hiring-can-be-efficient\" aria-label=\"hiring can be efficient permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Hiring can be efficient</h3>\n<p>Thanks to hiring software that streamline application processes for candidates, online reputation systems and machine learning, you can automate the heaviest steps of hiring.</p>\n<p>The most extreme example is probably programmers.

There are <strong>multiple areas of knowledge that still resemble the Industrial Era</strong>. Those in which you need <strong>expensive resources</strong> in order to learn, and usually education institutions provide you with that. An example would be a physicist that wants to study something that can only be studied at CERN. As of today, simulation software is not that advanced as to replicate the multi-billion dollar beast that CERN is.</p>\n<p>However, if you want to learn stuff that doesn’t need expensive resources and you are a <strong>smart and driven individual</strong>, the answer is probably yes.</p>\n<p>Being smart and driven are key. I hear this argument sometimes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>College forces you to learn stuff you don’t necessarily want to learn, but that could be useful in the future.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I find this argument laughable, as there’s no difference with the following variation of this statement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>A dictatorship forces you to do stuff you don’t necessarily want to do, but that could be useful in the future.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hiding in caves so you don’t get bombed could be useful knowledge for some hypothetical future. Therefore, we should totally live under a very oppressive dictatorship, since what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger! Obviously I am just kidding. This doesn’t make any sort of sense.</p>\n<p>For the smart and driven individual, they don’t need someone to occupy valuable brain space with some knowledge they’re putting down their throat.</p>\n<p>A smart individual would <strong>learn how to learn</strong>. To <strong>discern content and knowledge</strong>, and <strong>build a judgment</strong> in order to know what deserves brain space and what not.</p>\n<p>After learning how to learn, the smart individual would look for resources that are of interest in order to figure out what to do for a living, and then learn those hard skills.</p>\n<p>Since you would be teaching yourself, you would learn faster and better. This assumes you know yourself, which is usually not the case. Therefore <strong>self learning makes you learn about yourself</strong> first. And once you learn about yourself, <strong>you become your best teacher</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you properly learn how to learn, <strong>you will need no mentors</strong>, because humankind will be your mentor. You will plug to the Internet and absorb information like a sponge, re-balance your learning process and repeat.</p>\n<p>Having this feedback cycle sets you apart from all traditional students, who haven’t made the hard effort to learn how to learn. Instead, they have been taught. When the world evolves at the pace it does today, <strong>those who can learn by themselves are in a superior evolutionary position</strong>.</p>\n<p>Of course, this requires driven individuals. Not having a preset path requires to self-manage yourself. While supporters of dictatorships don’t need to think too much, because everything is thought of for them, the driven individual needs to renounce to that easy path in order to regain thought freedom.</p>\n<h2 id=\"value-your-opportunity-cost\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#value-your-opportunity-cost\" aria-label=\"value your opportunity cost permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Value your opportunity cost</h2>\n<p>If you are a smart and driven individual and you made it to this point, then next step is to assess your situation to make a decision.</p>\n<p><strong>College is always there</strong>, so you can always go back to it.</p>\n<p>If you drop out, you can either learn full-time, work full-time (which is also learning) or do both part-time.</p>\n<p>If you want to work, you need to estimate the returns you could make. You can probably start working with a small or nonexistent compensation. Then after a year or two years of experience, you can move on to a position with an average pay. At the forth year, you will be experienced enough to access wider opportunities. And <strong>you would have 4 years of experience already, while your college peers would have just graduated</strong> with 0 years of experience.</p>\n<p>But probably not the best route if you’re still undecided on what to work on.</p>\n<p><strong>80% of the success of your career is picking the right area to work on</strong>, with the right people, and the right time. The other 20% is just working your ass off to make sure to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>\n<p>This means that you need to think carefully about the career you want to take, the people you want to work with or learn from, and the timing. People rarely think about this, as <strong>it is somehow given for granted that you’ll just magically know what to do for a lifetime when you are 16</strong>. This is also inherited from the Industrial system, where you would just pick the least disgusting job from a set of totally predefined ones.</p>\n<p>So you can dedicate a full year to try stuff out, work with different people and explore different areas of knowledge. <strong>You can get to know yourself</strong>.</p>\n<p>Once you know what motivates you and what you are good at, then it’s the matter of finding the right people. Those people can gather around a subreddit, a cryptoasset, a forum… and the good thing about being free, is that you don’t have to blindly commit to an education institution and its community, but you can belong to multiple communities.</p>\n<p>This all without actually keeping in mind that <strong>technological revolutions are scarce</strong>. Something like the crypto revolution only happens once in a century, probably even a millennium. Similar for smaller revolutions, like the Internet or microprocessor revolution.</p>\n<p>You don’t necessarily need to drop out in order to be a part of those revolutions.
